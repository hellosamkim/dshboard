Total Time Taken: ~18hrs 
- extra +2hrs for learning and applying angular
- 40% coding, 40% thought process & research, 20% working with photoshop
-- Most of the time for my research related to making the Active player & Active tournament charts. I 
had a hard time coming up with a chart that would look pixel-perfect to the psd file. I ended up using the Chart.js framework to supplement my work.
